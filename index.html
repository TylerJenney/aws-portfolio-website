    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cloud Intern - WestRock</strong> (May - Aug 2024)
            <p>Before my internship at WestRock, my knowledge of cloud computing was limited. However, working with a highly skilled and knowledgeable Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) team, I gained invaluable hands-on experience in AWS and cloud technologies. I learned how to architect and manage cloud environments, optimize infrastructure for cost and performance, and implement security best practices. Collaborating with experts in the field allowed me to develop technical proficiency in cloud automation, monitoring, and compliance while also strengthening my problem-solving and analytical skills.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Server - Topgolf</strong> (Customer Service & Sales)
            <p>At Topgolf, I refined my <strong>soft skills</strong>, including <strong>customer service, communication, problem-solving, and teamwork</strong>. I learned how to work in a <strong>fast-paced environment</strong>, effectively <strong>handle customer interactions</strong>, and develop strong <strong>time management and adaptability</strong> skills. These experiences have helped me build a <strong>customer-focused mindset</strong> and enhance my ability to work in diverse team environments.</p>

            <h2>How This Website Was Built</h2>
            <p>This website is built using AWS cloud services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Amazon S3:</strong> Static website hosting</li>
                <li><strong>Route 53:</strong> Custom domain management</li>
                <li><strong>CloudFront:</strong> Global content delivery</li>
                <li><strong>AWS Lambda, API Gateway & DynamoDB:</strong> Serverless visitor counter</li>
                <li><strong>IAM (Identity and Access Management):</strong> Controls permissions for each service</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This website is hosted on AWS using Amazon S3 for static site hosting, CloudFront for global content delivery and SSL security, and Route 53 for domain management. 
                A serverless visitor counter is implemented using API Gateway, AWS Lambda (Python), and DynamoDB to track site visits. Security is enforced through IAM roles, bucket policies, and CORS settings.
                The resume download is served via CloudFront, ensuring fast and secure access. This architecture provides a scalable, cost-efficient, and high-performance web solution fully powered by AWS.
            </p>
            <p><strong>I will be constantly expanding this website with new features that use all sorts of AWS services in the future!</strong></p>
